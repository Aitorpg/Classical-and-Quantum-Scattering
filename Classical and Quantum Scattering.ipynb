    "The nature of this project is totally pedagogic. As I was finishing the career I thought about contributing my grain of sand in physics by helping those students who are starting now. Most of the concepts learned in physics are not very intuitive and in most of the cases some examples are needed to understand them. From my experience, visualizing them was the most difficult part. So, in order to avoid these problems I find it useful teaching them in a interactive way, in a way in which the students could participate in their learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to see how the classical and quantum scattering can be explained in a interactive way. Due to the nature of this project I find it useful to program it in a open source language, as it is Python. In this way, anybody who is interested in this topic will be able to enjoy it.\n",

    "This chapter reviews the classical theory describing the scattering of a beamed particle from a target particle. In order to make it interactive, for each explanation or graphic will be some changeable paramaters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Deflection function\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain what the deflection function is , the easiest way is to ilustrate it. In the figure 1 we can see how a poyectile coming from the infinite approaches a target. Taking the incident direction to be horizontal, the initial vertical distance b from the target is called the impact parameter. Once the particle has passed through the interaction area, it is scattered to a deflection angle $\\Theta$ at infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](Scattering1.jpg)\n",
    "$$Figure\\hspace{0.1in}1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One could think that for each value of b corresponds an unique $\\Theta$. The truth is that in some cases different values of b finish with the same angle. Usually, the value of b cannot be determined experimentally, so a relationship between b and $\\Theta$ is needed. Thus, $\\Theta$(b), the deflection function is expressed by \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Theta(b) = \\pi - 2 \\int_{r_{min}}^\\infty \\frac{b}{r^{2}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{V(r)}{E}-\\frac{b^{2}}{r^{2}}}}\\mathrm{d}r\\hspace{0.5in}(1.1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The deflection function needs to be calculated numerically. However, in the case of the Rutherford scattering the solution is analitic. In fact, the result is the one described for the kepler´s orbits, from where we get the following relation between b and $\\Theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b=\\frac{k}{2E}cot(\\frac{\\Theta}{2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we find out useful the following expressions for the exccentricity and $r_{min}$:\n",

    "$$ e = \\sqrt{1+\\frac{4E^{2}b^{2}}{k^{2}}} \\hspace{0.2in}\n",
    "    r_{min} = \\frac{2Eb^{2}}{k(\\pm e-1)}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "To demonstrate that the implementation works correctly we are going to compare the analitic and numerical solutions of the Rutherford scattering. We will introduce some changeable parameters so that the user could play and interact with them. Using ipywidgets this task becomes very easy. The result is ilustrated in the following graphic,"

In 1909 Ernest Rutherford directed the Geiger-Marsden experiment which suggested that the Thomson´s plum pudding model of the atom was incorrect. This experiment was based on hiting a thin gold foil with beamed $\\alpha$ particles. These ones where defrected to different directions with different deflection angles. \n",

This was the evidence that Rutherford saw in his experiment to understand that the plum-pudding model was totally incorrect. In essence, at distances near to radius of the nucleus, the beamed particles interact heavily with the nucleus. Thus, the nucleus , as Rutherford said \\cite{rutherford}, is composed of neutrons and protons concentrated in the center of the atom. \n",

In this case , with increasing b the scattering angles decreases. \n",

As b further increases, the time the particle spends on the interaction area decreases, and therefore the scattering angle $\\theta$ also does. In this case, the maximum scattering angle reached by the particles beam is called the __rainbow angle__.\n",

    "On the other hand, we have the glory scattering, which is shown generally for attractive potentials. It is based particularly in the effect a particle produces when is rejected with a deflection angle near $\\pm\\pi$. These angles produce an infinite cross section.

    "Here we can see for the lower energy that the differential cross section is isotropic as it has been calculated only with the s-wave. However, the contributions of other angular momentums would be extremely small and it ends up to be a good approximation. This does not happen with higher energies, with $ka=1.0$ for example. In this case, we get a maximum at forward angles. Moreover, something curious happens comparing it with the classical result, which is constant no matter what energy do we have. At backward angles they coincide almost with the same value due to the decreasement of de Broglie wavelenght  with the increasement of the energy. "
