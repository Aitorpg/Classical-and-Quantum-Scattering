# Classical-and-Quantum-Scattering

The nature of this project is totally pedagogic. As I was finishing the
career I thought about contributing my grain of sand in physics by helping
those students who are starting now. Most of the concepts learned in physics
are not very intuitive and in most of the cases some examples are needed
to understand them. From my experience, visualizing them was the most
difficult part. So, in order to avoid these problems I find it useful teaching
them in a interactive way, in a way in which the students could participate
in their learning process.

In order to achieve that goal it is going to be ilustrated how the classical and
quantum scattering can be explained in a interactive way. Due to the social
nature of this project it is useful to program it in a open source language,
as it is Python.
